Detection of Rice Leaf Disease Using Machine Learning Technique .

Developed a YOLOv8-based model to detect rice leaf diseases with an F1-score of 0.717. Utilized Google Colab,
Python, and CVAT.ai for data preprocessing and model implementation, enhancing agricultural sustainability through
early disease detection.
